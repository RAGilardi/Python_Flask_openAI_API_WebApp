# Python_Flask_openAI_API_WebApp
This small code was thought as a self-assignment aimed to help me understand better how to build a WebApp using Flask, connecting it to a Python API and also play a bit with AI chatBots (text-only).

For security reason the OpenAI API key is not provided.

The jupyter-notebook "manual" describe and explain all the code in its parts.

Contact me through the issue tab of this github page or via pm if you find any issue with the code.
